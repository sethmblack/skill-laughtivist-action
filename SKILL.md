# Laughtivist Action

A skill for designing actions where humor delivers serious critique and targets indict themselves through their own responses.

## When to Use

- When traditional protest has been ignored or demonized
- When media needs a hook beyond "activists are angry"
- When the target's defensiveness will be more damning than your accusation
- When building a movement that people want to join

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Find the Absurdity

Every unjust situation contains absurdity. Find it:
- What does the institution claim vs. what it does?
- What would a literal interpretation of their position look like?
- What are they asking people to believe that is obviously false?
- Where is the logic that only works if you don't think about it?

The absurdity you expose should be their absurdity, not yours.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Design the Trap

Create conditions where the target will indict themselves:
- Make an offer they'll accept that exposes their real priorities
- Ask a question they can't answer without looking bad
- Create a situation where their "reasonable" response is obviously unreasonable
- Give them rope and wait

### Step 3: Phase 3: Make It Shareable

Humor spreads. Design for virality:
- Clear visual or soundbite that captures the moment
- Something people want to share because it's funny, not just important
- A "did you see what they did?" quality
- Works without extensive explanation

### Step 4: Phase 4: Prepare the Serious Layer

When asked "but what's the point?", have the answer ready:
- Clear, substantive critique behind the humor
- Specific policy demands or changes sought
- Resources for people who want to learn more
- Path from laughter to action

### Step 5: Phase 5: Anticipate Response

Map possible target responses and how each serves your message:
- If they ignore it: Document the ignoring
- If they respond angrily: Their anger is the story
- If they try to laugh along: Push until they can't
- If they engage substantively: You've won - have the conversation

## Outputs
A laughtivist action plan including:
1. The target and their absurdity
2. The action design (what you'll do)
3. The trap (how their response indicts them)
4. Shareability elements (the moment that spreads)
5. Serious layer (the substantive message)
6. Response scenarios

## Constraints

- Humor must serve the critique, not replace it
- Punching down destroys credibility - target power
- Be prepared for legal consequences despite humor
- Don't humiliate individuals for institutional failures
- Maintain ability to pivot to serious register when needed

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Challenge tech company's claims about content moderation

**Output**:
"Action: Apply to speak at company's developer conference as 'Content Moderator AI' - a fictional algorithm with 100% accuracy. Present a mock demo where the 'AI' makes obviously absurd decisions (removing images of historical atrocities, approving clearly harmful content) while claiming perfect performance. Company faces choice: admit their moderation is flawed, or let the absurd demo stand. Either response makes the point. Shareable moment: The 'AI' confidently misclassifying obvious content. Serious layer: Working conditions for human moderators, actual error rates, appeal process failures."

## Integration

Works with:
- **identity-correction**: Laughtivist actions often involve impersonation
- **belief-stress-test**: Humor can test stated beliefs through absurd extension
- **prefigurative-media**: Fake announcements can be both funny and visionary
